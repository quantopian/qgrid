Qgrid API Documentation
=======================

within a `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook>`_.

Other qgrid resources

This page hosts only the API docs for the project.  You might also be interested in these other qgrid-related
resources:

`qgrid on GitHub <https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid>`_
  This is where you'll find the source code and the rest of the documentation for the project, including the
  instructions for installing and running qgrid.

`qgrid demo on nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/TimShawver/b4bc80d1128407c56c9a>`_
  See a demo of qgrid in your browser without installing anything.  The functionality of qgrid is somewhat limited
  in this environment, but it'll give you an idea of how the grid will look and feel when you install it locally.
