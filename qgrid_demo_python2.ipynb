    "======================================\n",
    "Qgrid is an IPython widget which uses a javascript library called SlickGrid to render pandas DataFrames within a Jupyter notebook.  It was developed for use in [Quantopian's hosted research environment]( https://www.quantopian.com/research?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=qgrid-nbviewer)."

    "* [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) is a javascript grid which allows users to scroll, sort, \n",
    "and filter hundreds of thousands of rows with extreme responsiveness.  \n",
    "* [Pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) is a powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, and DataFrames are the primary way of storing and manipulating two-dimensional data in pandas.\n",

    "[Qgrid](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) renders pandas DataFrames as SlickGrids, which enables users to explore the entire contents of a DataFrame using intuitive sorting and filtering controls.  It's designed to be used within Jupyter notebook, and it's also mostly functional when rendered by [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython\n",

    "This step is required because at this point all you've done to install qgrid is to call `pip install`.  Pip doesn't know which folder your Jupyter notebook widgets need to get copied to (let's call this the \"widgets folder\"), only the Jupyter notebook process knows that.  So you need to run one line of code from within the Jupyter notebook to copy qgrid to the widgets folder.  This only has to be done once for a particular version of qgrid.  That being said, if you're running qgrid from it's source code and making changes to it's source code, you'll need to run this line every time you make a change, or else the changes won't do anything.  See our [API docs for the nbinstall function](http://qgrid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#qgrid.nbinstall) for more details."
